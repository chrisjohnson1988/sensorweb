# Puppet Managaged 52° North  - A Vagrant Box

This is the a 52° North SOS webserver, it will allow you to spin up an instance of the [SOS](http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/sos/) webapp with all the prerequisite software installed. Have a look in the Puppetfile to see which modules are being installed onto your vagrant box

## Booting up your vagrant machine

To boot up your vagrant machine you will have to install either virtualbox or vmware workstation and vagrant. I won't go into the details on how to do this, but if you need help you should be able to find the answers [here](www.google.com)

Once everything is installed, open up a terminal window and execute: 
    
    vagrant up

Starting up your vagrant box for the first time may take a little while.
